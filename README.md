# An experiment in implementing Neural Network AI in Phaser 3 (WIP)

This is a WIP demo for a sophisticated AI implementation within the Phaser JS web game engine. I created this demo to experiment with using groups of multilayer perceptrons to create sophisticated AI that observes it's surroundings, has an internal context, and moves using neural networks.

Initially a runnable demo just testing NN movement, I significantly expanded the codebase and it presently needs some further work before it is runnable again. However in it's present state it is highly commented both descriptively and with TODOs to help understand the direction it's going in. I will update this README with running instructions once a release candidate is ready - I have posted it early as one interesting example of some personal projects I am working on.

 - Phaser 3 for the game engine
